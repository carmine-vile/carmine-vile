			<p>"PS 185 sat in the middle of city housing, separated by a patch of asphalt surrounded by a chain link fence. Recess was a time of discovery&mdash;you got to see who visited your building during the day&mdash;who came and went when others weren't around. Sometimes mom would peek out the window and shout. The far side of the fence had a gate so tall it touched the sky. Chained shut, the gate budged a little if you pushed it&mdash;kids were always trying to squeeze through. Hector Rodriguez got stuck once&mdash;the fire department came to get him out."</p>
			<p>"In six years of primary school I never saw that gate open&mdash;not even once."</p>
			<p>"You just had to use your imagination."</p>
