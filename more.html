			<h2>A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE.</h2>
			<p>The administrators of this site use the complimentary platform <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank"><em>Google Analytics 4</em></a> to monitor traffic and pageviews. These types of services measure and record the arrrival of visitors to a website and the choices they make while visiting&mdash;what they read, watch or listen to, download or share, what brings them, where they go when they're through, and how long they spend. This information guides decsion making as to what works and what doesn't when we develop new content and choose how to present it.</p>
			<p>GA4 gathers pertinent information by inserting small text files ("cookies") into the browser on your device which last for a predetermined amount of time&mdash;days to years even&mdash;until they expire or are deleted by the user. These cookies send information to Google's servers pertaining to the general location and browsing behavior of visitors. This information is available to the website administrators and content creators by means of a dashboard and as specific reports that help us judge the popularity of content and how it's presented&mdash;and to demonstrate to anyone interested that we're not simply howling in the wind.</p>
			<p>None of this is novel or original. It's simply how the internet works.</p>
			<p>There is substantial debate as to how anonymous and impersonal the information collected by cookies&mdash;and Google&mdash;really is. Cetain jurisdictions, namely the State of California and the European Union, have enacted relatively strict legistlation regarding the collection by anyone of data deemed excessively personal and thus able to identify an individual. Such data is said to belong to the individual which it purportedly identifies who in turn enjoys the right to opt out of such collection.</p>
			<p>As far as this website is concerned, cookies are a benign, automated way of providing feedback to content creators as to whether our efforts have an audience or not. Like all resources, your attention is finite and valuable, and we want to attract it more effectively&mdash;to rise above the din&mdash;by offering what matters most in your eyes in ways that invite you to build a lasting relationship. Above all, we want you to feel confident in the quality of what we offer and excited by its relevance&mdash;so much so that you will share it with others.</p>
			<p>Google, of course, derives its income from data mining and targeted marketing. This site does not. </p>
			<p>To put it into perspective, if you came here by way of social media you have already consented to considerably more invasive terms and practices. That isn't always a negative&mdash;just an honest assessment.</p>
