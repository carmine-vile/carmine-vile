			<p>They say it has to be in plain speak.</p>
			<p>Well, here it is.</p>
			<p><strong>It gleams.</strong></p>
			<p>All that stuff we built? The tech? The apps? We gave you the world on a screen the size of your palm&mdash;the power to drown out silence, alter the scenery, make any moment your own, define reality any way you choose. It came with a catch, of course&mdash;a siphon on your wages, a continuous hole in your pocket or wallet or purse. It's all by design. You didn't see it coming. You swear it isn't happening. Those who make the magic use it to harness your autonomy. Look there! Click here! Is it a spell? A trance? You chose all this, right? Millions spent on marketing mean nothing. Instant gratification seduces like nothing else out there, and that's without ever going to a porn site. There are few commodities as valuable as a captive audience.</p>
			<p>That thing you can't put away without feeling real pain? That's not a phone. It's a portable, pocket-able, personalized advertising delivery platform. Once there were billboards along the highway and newspapers in a box on the corner, a TV on a stand across the room. Today, the content you seek seeks you, literally inches before your eyes. The distance between those who want your attention and you has never been less. Put it down. I dare you. You won't. Whether you can or can't is almost moot. You won't. And even if you did, no one else on the block will. </p>
			<p>They want your attention. I want your attention. So does every startup and every one else who's out to make a name and a buck or at least a difference.</p>
			<p>Broadcast TV delivered programming to the audience and the audience to the advertisers. Print was no different. Nothing's changed with today's gig except the ubiquity, intensity, and specificity. It's always on, always in your face, and always zeroed in on you. Sure, there's an off button, but nobody ever uses it. Those who make the tech use it to gather information about&mdash;and sell access to&mdash;the users. Just about everybody understands that these days. You don't tell us everything&mdash;you tell us just enough to know where you fit in and how you see yourself and what it takes to make you happy, how you're willing to respond, what you're ready to believe in. That's all we ever needed to give you all you ever wanted.</p>
			<p>What harm does it do? What difference does it make? You construct your identity with the purchases you make, the brands you consume, the <em>things you identify with</em>. We harvest your dreams and desires just to sell them back to you as trinkets to wear and discard before the next batch arrives. It's not an invasion of privacy when you know perfectly well how the system works and you come back for more, again and again. At that point showing up is consent, never mind the money in your hand.</p>
			<p><strong>Until it doesn't.</strong></p>
			<p>He Wept subscribes to <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank"><em>Google Analytics</em></a>, a complimentary platform that gives us a general idea of how interesting the public finds our content. This service measures the arrival of visitors to our site and the choices they make while visiting&mdash;what they read, watch or listen to, download or share, what brings them, where they go when they're through, and how long they spend. This information helps us understand what works and what doesn't when we develop new content and choose how to present it.</p>
			<p>Google Analytics gathers information by inserting small text files called cookies into the browser on your device where they last for a predetermined amount of time&mdash;days to years even&mdash;until they expire or are deleted by the user. Cookies tell Google's servers roughly where the audience is located and how they engage with our content. This information appears on a dashboard and in specific reports that help us judge whether something is popular&mdash;and to demonstrate to anyone interested that we're not simply howling in the wind.</p>
			<p>None of this is novel or original. It's simply how the internet works.</p>
			<p>Some folks disagree as to how anonymous and impersonal the information gathered by cookies&mdash;and Google&mdash;really is. Certain jurisdictions, namely the State of California and the European Union, have legislated against the collection of cookie derived data  without first obtaining explicit permission from you. This is why you see so called cookie banners that ask your preferences when first visiting a website.</p>
			<p>As far as He Wept is concerned, the cookies of Google Analytics are benign enough, all things considered. A small cog in a big machine. They tell us whether anyone reads and shares what we have written. The jeers and applause of the digital era. We do not collect or harvest any information that personally identifies you. We don't violate your privacy. Heck, we don't even have a mailing list, so spam won't be an issue either.</p>
			<p>There's one thing we know&mdash;you only have so much time and energy, patience and attention. We can't get this wrong. We don't want to be second best. To build this brand, we must connect with what matters most in your eyes in ways that invite you to come back, again and again. You must feel confident in the quality of what we offer and excited by its relevance&mdash;so much so that you will share it with others. That's the prize.</p>
			<p>Google, of course, derives its income from data mining and targeted marketing. He Wept does not.</p>
			<p>To put it into perspective, if you came here by way of social media you have already consented to considerably more invasive terms and practices than anything we could dream up. Cookies are the least of your problems.</p>
