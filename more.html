			<p>They say it has to be in plain speak.</p>
			<p>Well, here it is.</p>
			<p><strong>Premises.</strong></p>
			<p>All that stuff we built? The tech? The apps? We gave you the world on a screen the size of your palm&mdash;the power to drown out silence, alter the scenery, make any moment your own, define reality any way you choose. It came with a catch, of course&mdash;a siphon on your wages, a continuous hole in your pocket or wallet or purse. It's all by design. You didn't see it coming. You swear it isn't happening. Those who make the magic use it to harness your autonomy. Look there! Click here! Is it a spell? A trance? You chose all this, right? Millions spent on marketing mean nothing. Instant gratification seduces like nothing else out there, and that's without ever going to a porn site. There are few commodities as valuable as a captive audience.</p>
			<p>That thing you can't put away without feeling real pain? That's not a phone. It's a portable, pocketable, personalized advertising delivery platform. Once there were billboards along the highway and newspapers in a box on the corner, a TV on a stand across the room. Today, the content you seek seeks you, literally inches before your eyes. The distance between those who want your attention and you has never been less. Put it down. I dare you. You won't. Whether you can or can't is almost moot. You won't. And even if you did, no one else on the block will. </p>
			<p>They want your attention. I want your attention. So does every startup and every one else who's out to make a name and a buck or at least a difference.</p>
			<p>Broadcast TV delivered programming to the audience and the audience to the advertisers. Print was no different. Nothing's changed with today's gig except the ubiquity, intensity, and specificty. It's always on and always zeroed in on you. Sure, there's an off button, but nobody ever uses it. Those who make the tech use it to gather information about&mdash;and sell access to&mdash;the users. Just about everybody understands that these days. You don't tell us everything, just enough to know where you fit in and how you see yourself and what it takes to make you happy, how you're willing to respond, what you're ready to believe in. That's all we ever needed to give you all you ever wanted.</p>
			<p>What harm does it do? What difference does it make? You construct your identity with the purchases you make, the brands you consume, the things you identify with. We harvest your dreams and desires just to sell them back to you as trinkets to wear and discard before the next batch arrives. It's not an invasion of privacy when you know perfectly well how the system works and you go back for more. At that point showing up is consent, never mind the money in your hand.</p>
			<p><strong>Practices.</strong></p>
			<p>The administrators of this site use the complimentary platform <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank"><em>Google Analytics 4</em></a> to monitor traffic and pageviews. These types of services measure and record the arrrival of visitors to a website and the choices they make while visiting&mdash;what they read, watch or listen to, download or share, what brings them, where they go when they're through, and how long they spend. This information guides decsion making as to what works and what doesn't when we develop new content and choose how to present it.</p>
			<p>GA4 gathers pertinent information by inserting small text files ("cookies") into the browser on your device which last for a predetermined amount of time&mdash;days to years even&mdash;until they expire or are deleted by the user. These cookies send information to Google's servers pertaining to the general location and browsing behavior of visitors. This information is available to the website administrators and content creators by means of a dashboard and as specific reports that help us judge the popularity of content and how it's presented&mdash;and to demonstrate to anyone interested that we're not simply howling in the wind.</p>
			<p>None of this is novel or original. It's simply how the internet works.</p>
			<p>There is substantial debate as to how anonymous and impersonal the information collected by cookies&mdash;and Google&mdash;really is. Cetain jurisdictions, namely the State of California and the European Union, have enacted relatively strict legistlation regarding the collection by anyone of data deemed excessively personal and thus able to identify an individual. Such data is said to belong to the individual which it purportedly identifies who in turn enjoys the right to opt out of such collection.</p>
			<p>As far as this website is concerned, cookies are a benign, automated way of providing feedback to content creators as to whether our efforts have an audience or not. Like all resources, your attention is finite and valuable, and we want to attract it more effectively&mdash;to rise above the din&mdash;by offering what matters most in your eyes in ways that invite you to build a lasting relationship. Above all, we want you to feel confident in the quality of what we offer and excited by its relevance&mdash;so much so that you will share it with others.</p>
			<p>Google, of course, derives its income from data mining and targeted marketing. This site does not.</p>
			<p>To put it into perspective, if you came here by way of social media you have already consented to considerably more invasive terms and practices. That isn't necessarily a negative&mdash;just an honest assessment.</p>
