            <h3 class="flushL">Why do brands matter?</h3>
            <p class="flushL">We can talk about individual and social psychology, and we should, but the straightest path to answering this question is to ask another. "What's in it for me?"</p>
            <p class="flushL">Brands appeal to our desire to define ourselves in ways that make us feel better. Sure, they cost&mdash;but, boy, do they deliver!</p>
            <p class="flushL">Brands make us feel better about our lives by rewarding us with what we crave&mdash;the power to influence how others see us, but more than anything, the power to influence how we see ourselves.</p>
            <p class="flushL">There's a direct link between the brands we consume and the identity we project. That identity becomes our own personal brand of sorts, and we are first in line to consume it, to bask in it, revel in it, devour it. You might say that's really the whole point. We're our own biggest fans; the idolatry never ends.</p>
            <p class="flushL">Brands allow us to define ourselves, to invent not only what others see but what we live with from day to day. We dress the part, drive the car, listen to the music, follow the fads, and hold the opinions of the folks we want to be, the group we want to belong to.</p>
            <p class="flushL">Brands externalize primitive desires giving us feedback in real time that we have managed to become the things to which we aspire&mdash;or at least seem to become them. They allow us to tell a story and to believe it's true, as true as anything can be when manufactured and simulated. Sure, brands elicit the approval of others (and stir up their envy), but the grand prize is on the inside&mdash;we get to approve of ourselves, at least for today.</p>
            <p class="flushL">Brands take us from wherever we are to somewhere we'd much rather be&mdash;at least for the moment. Nothing else does. Not as quickly or efficiently. Or convincingly.</p>
            <p class="flushL">Contemporary mainstream society has gone all in on this for as long as anyone alive can remember.</p>
            <p class="flushL">This isn't about mannequins in a store window. This is about how we understand reality. Measured. Monitored. Packaged. Purchased. An assembly line of experiences.</p>
            <p class="flushL">Want Real&trade;? Here's your real.</p>
            <p class="flushL" style="font-size:125%;"><strong>&hellip;authenticity derived from appearances, found in identification with clever advertising campaigns designed to manipulate opinion and modify behavior.</strong></p>
            <p class="flushL" style="font-size:75%;">THE NEW REAL</p>
            <p class="flushL">That's all there is. That's all there ever was. That's all that's left.</p>
