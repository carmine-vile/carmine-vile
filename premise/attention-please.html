                <h3 class="flushL">There won't be an intermission.</h3>
                <p class="flushL">But you're free to get up and roam around.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Here's the thing with the internet.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Everybody is trying to sell you something.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Why?</p>
                <p class="flushL">Because you're buying. That's why.</p>
                <p class="flushL">It's not always about credit cards and shipping preferences. You're looking for answers. Solutions to a problem.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Even if it's just how to kill the next ten minutes.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Never before in the history of mankind has the distance been shorter between those who want your attention (<strong>to get you to do things that benefit them</strong>) and you. Forty-two years ago somebody sang, "I've got thirteen channels of s*** on the TV to choose from." You can no longer count the distractions available&mdash;many even appear free at first glance&mdash;if you don't count the time wasted, the opportunity thrown away. (But then sometimes that's what you're after&mdash;isn't it?)</p>
                <p class="flushL">The cynical tell us we're being played, but by whom? Retailers? Manufacturers? The mass media that serves them? Nobody put a gun to your head. You signed up for all this, for free&mdash;remember?</p>
                <p class="flushL">Here's a thought. What if the players and the playees are one and the same? What if it really is All About You&trade;, like they've been telling you all along? I know, I know. You didn't invent Google. Your needs did.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Look at it this way. The whole thing is theater, and we are both the actors and the audience. We're being played. but we wanted it this way&mdash;we wrote the script. We bought the tickets. We'll stay for the encore.</p>
                <p class="flushL">Sure, there's a man behind the curtain" (a reference most kids today won't get), but he's only there to entertain us, and <strong>if we didn't respond to his pulling the levers and turning the dials</strong>, he'd be sitting at home collecting benefits and dreaming of opening a dispensary like everybody else.</p>
                <p class="flushL">At the end of the day, every day, we're being catered to, courted, cajoled, and conned because we've got something they want&mdash;discretionary income, votes, consent, acquiescence, a role to play&mdash;and they've got something we want&mdash;comfort and convenience, sure, but it's bigger than that. Answers. Solutions. Relief. A way to kill the next ten minutes. Or the next thirty years.</p>
                <p class="flushL"><em>Following today's program, the souvenir stand will remain open as patrons exit the theatre. Posters, shot glasses, commemorative T-shirts. Buy One Get One Free!*</em></p>
