			<p><strong>I. </strong></p>
			<p>I think of you and I think TALL.<br>
			As we danced, the buttons on your shirt front<br>
			Pressed circles on my face,<br>
			Your angular cheekbones a sharp contrast<br>
			To my dimpled softness.</p>
			<p>The hormone-sweet smell of youth<br>
			Seeped through the starched white cotton of your shirt<br>
			As we waltzed carefree and young of heart<br>
			To the wedding altar.<br>
			We laughed often and joked of<br>
			Growing old together.</p>
			<p>I was radiant and dizzy with love<br>
			You called me your princess in lace veil<br>
			And white ruffles.</p>
			<p><strong>II. </strong></p>
			<p>Through open windows gossamer curtains<br>
			Blew freely in the wind.<br>
			The white ruffles waved in celebration<br>
			As we joined in primal mating on your grandmother's<br>
			Four poster bed.<br>
			Youthful lust waned as the babies came,<br>
			One-two-three robust and red cheeked.</p>
			<p>Hell-bent on perfection<br>
			I followed modern marriage manuals to the letter.<br>
			White ruffles were replaced by blue jeans and aprons.<br>
			You never did learn to like tuna in a casserole.</p>
			<p>And I never ever said no<br>
			To your fumbling hands sneaking the warmth of my body's secrets<br>
			Under hidden cover of the night.<br>
			Other nights I tuned in for the sound of your truck<br>
			Purring home at last in the driveway.</p>
			<p><strong>III. </strong></p>
			<p>One 2am you covered me with wafting dollar bills<br>
			Won in a craps game,<br>
			And I wondered what that had to do with the truck business,<br>
			But I wasn't going to harp like my mother.<br>
			They said she killed my father with a heart attack.<br>
			So I said nothing.<br>
			Your golden wedding band flew out of the window with a beer can<br>
			One blistery winter night<br>
			You said.<br>
			Your fingers were slim and shrunk from the cold<br>
			You said.</p>
			<p><strong>IV. </strong></p>
			<p>Was it 1987 we celebrated the new year<br>
			In the Laundromat?<br>
			We toasted new beginnings<br>
			Over the water sloshing and the<br>
			Whump-whump of tennis shoes in the dryer.<br>
			What followed was the first job lost.<br>
			(Due to missing company funds I was told.)<br>
			T'was not the last.<br>
			The spiral hastened<br>
			Down,<br>
			Always accompanied by a Schlitz Tallboy<br>
			Gripped tightly in your bony knuckles<br>
			Until the cool metal container became indistinguishable<br>
			From your hand.</p>
			<p><strong>V. </strong></p>
			<p>Frantic for a solution,<br>
			One night I sent the children away and<br>
			Served you steak and wine in unfamiliar candlelight that<br>
			Spiked eerie shadows over children's toys and the worn out high chair.<br>
			I used all the woman-tricks I knew<br>
			To ease the frown in your face.<br>
			I listened.<br>
			I laughed.<br>
			I cajoled.<br>
			I flirted.<br>
			I fucked,<br>
			But I could not compete with the golden liquid brew.<br>
			It gave you seductive solace I could not.<br>
			I was your judge and jury and<br>
			It had become your understanding,<br>
			Forever faithless friend.<br>
			My Pollyanna smile became a frozen grimace mask..<br>
			And I looked for shabby comfort wherever I could.<br>
			You never even noticed.</p>
			<p>Finally I fled,<br>
			<br>
			We become one more divorce statistic.<br>
			Dated May 18th.</p>
			<p><strong>VI. </strong></p>
			<p>The last time I saw you,<br>
			You sat heavily in our easy chair,<br>
			Gray trousers dark-stained and urine-damp.<br>
			Your head hung low.<br>
			Your watery blue eyes pleaded for help as the coffee cup trembled<br>
			In your long slender fingers.<br>
			Our children gaped in adolescent horror at the shrunken visage<br>
			Of their hero-daddy.<br>
			I didn't know what to do!<br>
			I couldn't return you to what you had become.<br>
			Spending nights in a cold borrowed car<br>
			Writing hot checks<br>
			Sleeping in a cemetery surrounded by metal vaults and stone pillars.<br>
			You surrendered meekly enough as<br>
			Our son dressed you up.<br>
			I tucked a clean white hanky in your pocket<br>
			And sent you home to the first woman who ever loved you.</p>
			<p>Safely tucked away in my file cabinet along with car titles,<br>
			Life insurance policies, and 20-year roof warranties is<br>
			The Coroner's Report.<br>
			"Self-Inflicted gunshot wound"<br>
			States the ragged piece of paper.<br>
			The death notice of white ruffles' dreams is<br>
			Dated May 18th.</p>
			<p><strong>VII. </strong></p>
			<p>Today I live in a reasonable world with reality as my companion.<br>
			My dreamy dimples have deepened with age<br>
			Thank God I no longer need fairy tale heroes.</p>
			<p>A pale flag flaps wildly in the winter wind.<br>
			White lilacs in the first blush of spring,<br>
			<br>
			White ruffle dreams into my grown-up mind.<br>
			Then<br>
			The warm body next to me moves closer<br>
			In the rustle of the night and<br>
			I imperfectly love an imperfect man.</p>
			<p>Gratitude bathes me in a rosy glow<br>
			As my heart smiles in the night.<br>
			I think of me and I know:<br>
			Blessed.<br>
			I think of you and I pray:<br>
			Peace.</p>
