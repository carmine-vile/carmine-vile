              <p>You Never Knew How They Would Turn Out.</p>
              <p>They never were much good those instant photos that came out of the machine at the mall.</p>
              <p>Two dollars. Four poses. Ready in minutes.</p>
              <p>You retrieved them from the chute, damp and sticky even after the blower switched off.</p>
              <p>Forced smiles. Awkward, made-up expressions. It was hard not to blink.</p>
              <p>The features were always blurred, the colors dark and run together or washed out when the chemicals needed changing.</p>
              <p>Call them a keepsake, a memento, a souvenir. They went home in a pocket to be set aside, forgotten like dreams and other things you bought.</p>
              <p>Then one day you discover them in a drawer of things that mattered once and marvel at who you were and who you've become and how the time has passed.</p>
              <p>There's only one thing left to do.</p>
              <p>Choose.</p>
              <p>Save them for a rainy day? Another rainy day like today.</p>
              <p>Or&mdash;</p>
              <p>Embrace the knowledge that no one really cares. There's no one coming after you to whom they will matter.</p>
              <p>The landfill awaits. Everything you ever cherished or thought you cherished or might cherish.</p>
              <p>Everything in that drawer and on that shelf and in that box in the closet.</p>
              <p>If you don't see it today, don't worry.  A time will come when it is crystal clear.</p>
              <p>The drawer they'll be closing is made of stainless steel and has you in it.</p>
