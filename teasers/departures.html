        <p><em>Sometimes, you have to stand still in order to find what really moves you.</em></p>
              <p>A man with a camera seizes the moment, capturing its complexity and simplicity all at once, finding clarity in the blur of sights and sounds, arranging color and structure and motion to suit his senses, to convey his message, to celebrate, to condemn, to empower, to undermine, to ask a question, to tell a story.</p>
