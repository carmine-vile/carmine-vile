			<p class="reverse">What if somebody told you that the road you're on led nowhere&mdash;before you got to the point of no turning back?</p>
			<p class="reverse">What if somebody showed you that you're making a big mistake&mdash;while you still had time to do something about it?</p>
			<p class="reverse">What if somebody gave you a glimpse, a hint, a moment of clarity&mdash;before you got stuck in a life that you hate?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Would you do things differently?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Would you slow down?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Would you listen?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Would you think twice?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Here's a clue.</p>
			<p class="reverse">Sometimes&mdash;maybe all the time, I don't know&mdash;</p>
			<p class="reverse">the destination isn't what you dream,</p>
			<p class="reverse">the consequences aren't what you imagine,</p>
			<p class="reverse">the payoff isn't anything like the promise,</p>
			<p class="reverse">the true cost is a lot more than the price on the sticker,</p>
			<p class="reverse">a hard road hides behind an easy first step,</p>
			<p class="reverse">rust sticks around a lot longer than glitter,</p>
			<p class="reverse">getting what you want doesn't mean you've won,</p>
			<p class="reverse">every betrayal starts with a kiss,</p>
			<p class="reverse">and new things grow old faster than you ever thought possible.</p>
			<blockquote>
				Maybe I'm full of s***. You decide.
			</blockquote>
			<p class="reverse">I'm twenty eight now, but I was seventeen once too. I thought I knew better then. Now I do.</p>
			<p class="reverse">Is this what is meant by coming full circle? Or trying to pay it forward? Or am I just kidding myself, because that's less painful that admitting that there is no hope at all, ever, anywhere.</p>
			<p class="reverse">I'm trying to tell you something, and I know you don't want to hear it. But I'm going to try anyway. I'm going to tell you something that will change your life if you'll give it half a chance.</p>
			<p class="reverse">I know you don't have to listen to me. I stopped listening as soon as I saw that I didn't have to anymore, not that anybody was saying anything meaningful anyway.</p>
			<p class="reverse">Maybe that's what makes this different. Maybe I have something to say that will help you avoid making the same mistakes I made, learning lessons the hard way, wishing every moment of every day that things were different.</p>
			<p class="reverse">Maybe I'm full of s***. You decide.</p>
			<p class="reverse">These are your choices, and they will have consequences. No getting out of that.</p>
			<p class="reverse">There's one last question that has to be asked, sooner or later. It may not make sense at the moment, but someday it will.</p>
			<p class="reverse">What would you give to get your innocence back?</p>
