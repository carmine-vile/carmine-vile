			<p><strong>This is meant to shake you up.</strong></p>
			<p>Dark. And way out of bounds.</p>
			<p><strong>Trato de Novios.</strong></p>
			<p>A man and a woman find each other and fall in love.</p>
			<p>Now, what could go wrong with that?</p>
			<p>Let me tell you.</p>
			<p>What are we really falling for when we fall in love? What do we really want? Why do we think we're going to get it here, this time, with this person?</p>
			<p>This one. Not that one. That one over there. No, not that one&mdash;the other. There's a line up. Some folks are in it, and others aren't. Not in our wildest dreams. Everybody has a prize in mind, something he or she wants. Who we seek&mdash;who we settle for&mdash;says a lot about us.</p>
			<p>He wanted to prove a point. To her. To himself mostly. He had what it takes to get noticed, to convince. Good looks weren't part of the equation.</p>
			<p>She knew perfectly well men only wanted one thing from her. That's been the case since she was sixteen. And they were only good for one thing in return. She had never met one who didn't or wasn't.</p>
			<p>They went through the motions. Don't scowl or scoff. It's what relationships are made of. It's how we get to know each other. It's how we get along.</p>
			<p>They clicked. Did you notice the weeds growing in the cracks of the sidewalk? They seem so much taller after the rain. Hope made a comeback today or at least a cameo.</p>
			<p>There was only one problem.</p>
			<p>This man and this woman&mdash;they met in a brothel. A massage parlour. Yeah, those things are legal in Mexico.</p>
			<p>Is that a problem? Why? Why is it a problem?</p>
			<p>And if it's not a problem&mdash;why not? How can it not be?</p>
			<p><strong>A continuaci√≥n / to be continued.</strong></p>
