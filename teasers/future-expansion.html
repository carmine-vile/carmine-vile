			<p class="reverse">Would you buy it?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Across a patch of asphalt lies a catch basin for run off surrounded by a chain link fence. Pasted along the horizon almost in silhouette, tract houses in cul de sacs languish.  Tomorrow's Community&mdash;today.  Once upon a time it gleamed.  Even the dirt was shiny and new.  Manicured shrubs, swing sets from Sears, patio furniture from Penny's, basketball hoops tacked above open garage doors, Country Squire station wagons, Kingsford charcoal briquettes, "rec rooms," Hot Wheels, Barbie, GI Joe...</p>
			<p class="reverse">Relics!</p>
			<p class="reverse">Overgrown, weed-filled yards, empty pools, and the occasional shattered window have taken their place. "For Sale" signs stand where kids' bikes once lay in the grass.  Dreams took root here; desires unfolded. Possibilities met limits, and something had to give.  Someone had to lose.  There are times in our lives when anything seems possible, but we know it rarely is.  That only comes out later.  What is Lot C?  Allegory?  Allusion?  Metaphor?  Icon?  All of the above.  To see what is and what will be, you need a vantage point.  YOU ARE HERE.</p>
			<p class="reverse">Not a charity.  Not a scheme.  Not a product or program.  Lot C Media employs no one and sells nothing.  There's no business model associated with this endeavor.  No attempt at monetization.  No appeal for donations.  No pay-pal link.  Nothing to join.  Nothing to buy.  No solicitation.  No fundraising.  No request for referrals.  No merchandise, not even a lousy tee shirt.  The list goes on, but you get the point.  The actual cost of maintaining the site is negligible.  Maybe that's a big mistake, but like every one we've ever made, it seems like the right thing to do at the moment.  <em>It let's us focus on the message.</em></p>
			<p class="reverse">Want to participate?  Collaborate?  Lose your identity in a purpose larger than yourself?  Stand on a street corner selling plastic flowers for a dime?</p>
			<p class="reverse">Drop us a line.</p>
